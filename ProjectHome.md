The ELMAH Sandbox is a playground for testing ideas and hosting ad-hoc community contributions for [ELMAH](http://elmah.googlecode.com/).

ELMAH Sandbox:

  * is an incubator.
  * is for people who feel grown up enough to run with scissors.
  * builds on top of ELMAH, not into it.
  * uses Mercurial for source control; doesn't require commit rights to contribute [so clone and hack away](DevelopmentProcess.md)!
  * will have possibly shorter (and independent) release cycles than ELMAH.
  * is a playground so any bit of implementation is subject to be removed or modified in an incompatible manner.
  * may contain bits that mature to migrate into the base ELMAH project.
  * may never amount to anything but it's in your hands now. :)

ELMAH is reasonably extensible. If you look for those extensibility points (the usual suspects like subclassing, events, interfaces), you may find that you don't need to change its source code and maintain a private fork just to customize one or two aspects. If you have built something on top of ELMAH that's generally applicable and would like to share with others then [clone away Sandbox](DevelopmentProcess.md)!
